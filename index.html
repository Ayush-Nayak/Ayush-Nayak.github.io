      Personally, I know quite a few languages, and am pretty good at quickly picking up frameworks, as well as knowing how to develop in all sorts of environments. <br><br>

      I am proficient in <span class="green">Python 3</span>, and know <span class="red">PyTorch</span>, <span class="pink">Jupyter</span>, <span class="cyan">Numpy</span>, <span class="green">SciPy</span>, <span class="red">Keras</span> and <span class="cyan">matplotlib</span>  as well as all the supporting libraries to build and process all sorts of ML data. Speaking of ML, I have done all sorts of ML projects from the gateway drug MNIST, to a CoreML multiple model detection algorithm, to a genetics deep learning project with model reconstruction.<br><br>

      I am also pretty good with <span class="cyan">C++</span>, and have a good grasp of all the libraries as well as algorithmic coding being a <span class="pink">USACO Silver </span>using mainly C++. While outside of emacs and vim and super perfect algorithmic problems, I have not used C++ for much production wise, I have used its brother <span class="red">C#</span>, in production environments (specifically Unity) and while that may not be the most noble use of a language, I do know it well and how to build for applications and not just CLI. I have used <span class="green">C</span> mostly for arduino's and other low level stuff, but tend to prefer C++ when possible. <br><br>

      As mentioned before, I have worked on iOS development, another introduction into production code, almost exclusively with <span class="red">Swift</span>, and know how to work with native and 3rd-Party Swift Frameworks, as well as have experience on most major ones.

      <br><br>

      For my genetics project as said above, I had to learn and have a good idea of scripting in <span class="pink">R</span>, mostly through RStudio.

      <br>
      I also can script in <span class="pink">JavaScript</span>, mostly in a website context, but also for other things. (though everyone knows how awful JS is so I like others would rather use *anything* else).
      <br>
      Another language I know but despise is <span class="green">Java</span> because you kind of have to know this language.

      <br><br>

      Speaking of web development, I have created many websites over the days, and am right at home with not only the front end, but the back end, having used <span class="red">Flask</span>, <span class="cyan">Django</span>, <span class="green">SQL</span> and <span class="yellow">PHP</span>, and built applications with all of them. I also have built with Azure, AWS, MongoDB and a host of other databases.

      <br><br>

      Of course after learning so much, I have acquired the skills to quickly pick up practically any framework or language extremely quickly.

      I have built a couple things, some cooler than others, with all of those aforementioned
      skills. <br><br>


      I can probably start off with my latest project, training classifiers to classify whether or not someone
      has Lung Cancer, through PyTorch and deep learning. After achieving over 93% accuracy, taking advantage of
      model reconstruction algorithms such as input manipulation and of course model heatmaps to be able to
      actually find out what the machine learning model got from the input data. This project is complete,
      although as of right now I haven't added it to my GitHub yet, due to it being for multiple competitions.
      You can check out the paper for the project <span class="green"><a href="https://github.com/Ayush-Nayak/ayushnayak/blob/main/Nayak_Ayush_Paper.pdf"> Here (Click)</a></span>
      
      <br><br>

      Along the same vein, I also created a Flask website to scan people's DNA and notify them of genetic issues they may have. The link is <span class="green"><a href="https://geneticai.azurewebsites.net/">Here (Click)</a></span>

      <br><br>

      I have coded multiple iOS apps, most recently an unfinished design for an app which uses CoreML too scan the surroundings of the device and relays information to a single audio source, designed to help the hard of sight, without compromising their sense of hearing, while still able to read signs, alert them of obstacles, and other visual only aspects of the world. <span class="green"><a href="https://github.com/Shad0wSeven/MLCoreProjectWorking">Code (unfinished, planning on continuing in the summer) (Click!)</a>
      </span>

      <br>
      Just for fun, I also made a simple quiz app with database support from PasteBin :D code is <span class="green"><a href="https://github.com/Shad0w7/Congressional-App-2020">Here (Click!)</a></span>
      <br><br>

    A fun project of mine with a friend that aimed to basically be QR codes on crack, send data through flashing 128x128 matrixes full of colors, between two devices. Unfortunately there is no real need for something like that, although we though it was cool <span class="green"><a href="https://x-squared.github.io/Blinding-Lights/">Website (Click!)</a></span>, <span class="green"><a href="https://github.com/x-squared/Blinding-Lights">Code (Click!)</a></span>
    
      <br><br>

      My favorite project of them all, is trying to with my friends build a <span class="red">drone capable of carrying a human for less than $10,000</span>, although to be frank I have no funding nor any hope of getting any. Although I do have cad models and tens of pages of documents and simulations of the drone if you are interested in just checking it out! <span class="green"><a href="https://x-squared.github.io/_/">Website (Click!)</a></span>, <span class="green"></span>
      
      I absolutely love Astronomy, and am currently doing research on Exoplanets and Binary Stars with an institute, and also helping maintain repositories for popular astronomy tools. <br><br>

      I am also working on bioinformatics projects with a professor, to put my scripting skills to use.

  <span class="inline-comment"><span class="red">[STDOUT]: </span> Of course I don't spend all my time running around picking up languages and coding.
<br>
I love computers and before learning to script, I picked up video editing in <span class="pink">Final Cut</span> and <span class="red">Da Vinci.</span>
<br>
To make cool stuff, CAD in <span class="cyan">Fusion360</span>, and <span class="green">SketchFab</span>, which I use to make mostly multipart drone models.
<br>
However I am most at home with VFX 3D, primarily <span class="red">Blender</span>, where you can check out stuff here: <a href="https://www.deviantart.com/shad0wseven">(Click).</a>
<br><br>
I use and am very familiar with <span class="cyan">macOS</span>, especially the <span class="red">*nix</span> side of things, and also have worked with <span class="green">Linux</span> and use Debian Mint mostly, but have tried Arch.
